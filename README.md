# My-Task

This is the repository for my task.

Postman Dump for the routes: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ad41663cfab1c5f34f43 .

I made the Back-End using NodeJS and ExpressJS, Front-End using ReactJS and React-Bootstrap, and Database used is MongoDB.

Folder structure:

- client: The ReactJS app for the Front-End

  - public: contains index.html and other images/icons (Default in this case).

  - src/components: This contains all the pages for the Front-End (3 in this case).

  - src/containers: Contains the app.js file which uses react-router-dom for the routing.

- controllers: The Controller functions for all the routes.

- models: The MongoDB models (Student Model in this case).

- public/profilePhotos: The storage of pictures.

- routes: The route file exists here (Student Routes in this case, individual route documentation can be found inside the file).
